The Arithmetic Logical Unit (ALU) is a block that performs arithmetic and logical operations. Among the arithmetic operations it performs, it adds, subtracts, divides, and determines whether a number is positive or negative or zero. It can also perform logic functions like "AND", "OR" or "OR EXCLUSIVE". A ULA is a basic building block of a computer's microprocessor or CPU.
