# Simple-Signal-Generator

Descrição
---

This board is intended to generate signals to buy on the oscilloscope, be your reference or for parallel projects can be used. 

I'm going to use in this project the HEF4069UB, this general purpose hexagonal inverter. Each inverter has a single stage. It operates on a recommended VDD power supply range of 3V to 15V with reference to VSS (generally grounded). Unused inputs must be connected to VDD, VSS or other input
