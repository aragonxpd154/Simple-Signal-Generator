# Simple-Signal-Generator

Description
---

This board is intended to generate signals for comparison on the oscilloscope, either your reference or for parallel projects to be used.

I'm going to use in this project the HEF4069UB, this general purpose hexagonal inverter. Each inverter has a single stage. It operates on a recommended VDD power supply range of 3V to 15V with reference to VSS (generally grounded). Unused inputs must be connected to VDD, VSS or other input
